# Remix / Hydrogen status

Still not a capable framework for page animations. Still can not deliver a single, clean exit-before-enter animation without remix's instant content dump.

★☆☆☆☆ Avoid!
Framework should be avoided, unless storefront suits run of the mill/ cookie cutter animations
Framework is more about the UI, not the UX. Not worth the sacrifice.
